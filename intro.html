    <p class="Information">
        The Space Race occurred from the 1950s to the 1970s. The main involved
        parties was the USSR and the US.
    </p>
    <p class="Information">
        While it is hard to determine a hard start and end date, I have decided
        to go with 1957 for a start as that is when the USSR launched Sputnik
        into space which is what started the process of both America and the
        USSR racing to get into space. I have also decided to go with 1970 as an
        end date as this was the last major event that occurred in the race to
        the moon.
