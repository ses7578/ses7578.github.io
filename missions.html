        Sputnik 1 was launched on October 4, 1957<sup><a href="#1" class="reference">1</a></sup> by the
        USSR, it would end up being the first of 5 different missions of the same name.  The mission of Sputnik 1 was
        to retrieve information about the the Earth's atmosphere and to retrieve information that would help
        in future missions by other satellites.

        Sputnik 2 is one of the most famous space missions in the world, it was the space mission that involved
        Laika the dog, the first creature to be launched into space<sup><a href="#2" class="reference">2</a></sup>.
        This mission was to retrieve information about how long a living creature could live in space.
        It was believed that Laika would live in space for 10 days and then return but an
        unfortunate circumstance caused her to die approximately 2 days into the mission due to a temperature
        issue.  This temperature issue was caused when some of the thermal insulation was torn loose,
        causing the cabin Laika was in to heat up to over 100 degrees.
    </p>
    <p class="Information">
        Sputnik 5 was the final successful and valuable Sputnik Mission.  It occurred in 1960<sup><a href="#3" class="reference">3</a></sup>
        and it was the first mission that successfully launched animals into space and they returned alive and
        healthy.  The dogs Strelka and Belka were launched into space and returned, alive, one day later proving
        that living creatures could go into space and return safely.

    <p class="Information">
        Luna 1 was the first spacecraft that reached the moon.  It was launched on January 2 1959.
        <sup><a href="#4" class="reference">4</a></sup>  Its primary mission was to measure the
        pressures that the inside of the spacecraft would feel to help to determine if life would be able to
        take to space and to study the gasses that existed in space.  Luna 1 determined that the Moon had no
        magnetic field and the Earth did.  It also observed the first solar winds from space. Luna 1 eventually
        went into orbit around the sun, also becoming the first spacecraft to orbit the sun, between the orbits
        of the Earth and the moon.  It is assumed that Luna 1 was meant to crash into Earth but it did not,
        that did not occur until Luna 2 later in 1959.
    </p>
    <p class="Information">
        Luna 2 was the first spacecraft to land on the moon, on September 14, 1959.<sup><a href="#5" class="reference">5</a></sup>
        Luna 2 landed near the Aristides, Archimedes, and Autolycus craters.  This mission confirmed the
        conclusion drawn from Luna 1 that the moon had no magnetic field and also determined that the moon
        had no evidence of radiation belts in the moon.  It also ran experiments about the behaviors of gas
        in space as it released clouds of colored sodium gasses that allowed for the tracking of the
        spacecraft from earth.

    <p class = "Title" id="MercuryRedstone">Mercury Redstone</p>
    <p class="Information">
        Mercury Redstone 2 was the first mission to have a humanoid creature to be launched into space and survive.
        <sup><a href="#6" class="reference">6</a></sup>  On January 21 1961, the United States
        successfully launched Mercury Redstone 2, the first spacecraft that had a chimpanzee on it.
        The purpose of this was to determine if humans were able to survive in space after the dog tests as
        a chimpanzee is closer to a human than a dog would be.  Mercury Redstone 2 determined that the
        chimpanzee was able to work and concentrate during the flight, allowing for the hopefully ability
        for humans to eventually go into space and be able to run things from up there.

    <p class = "Title" id="Vostok">Vostok</p>
    <p class="Information">
        Vostok 1 was the first spacecraft to have a human in space.  It was launched on April 12, 1961
        <sup><a href="#7" class="reference">7</a></sup> by the USSR, carrying 1 person into space.
        The purpose of this mission was to determine the effects of weightlessness a human would experience
        and because of this, the spacecraft was piloted from the ground for the safety of the human.  The
        mission lasted approximately 2 hours and following reenter, the human was meant to eject safely with
        a parachute instead of landing, which he did and was safely returned.

    <p class="Information">
        Apollo 8 was the first space mission that had humans orbit the moon and return.
        <sup><a href="#8" class="reference">8</a></sup> The United States launched Apollo 8 on
        December 21, 1968 with 4 astronauts.  The crew orbited the moon for 20 hours and became the first
        humans to see the far side of the moon.  Due to the time, these were the first humans who celebrated
        Christmas in space and there was a TV broadcast where the astronauts wished the people on Earth a
        merry christmas.
    </p>
    <p class="Information">
        Apollo 11 is one of the most famous space missions that have occurred, it is the first time where humans
        stepped foot onto the moon.  On July 16, 1969,<sup><a href="#9" class="reference">9</a></sup>
        the spacecraft launched into space with one mission, to be the first people on the moon.  While there,
        the astronauts conducted many experiments, including collecting information about the makeup of the moon
        and taking photos of the crater that the spacecraft landed in. There is, however, a conspiracy that
        Apollo 11 did not actually land on the moon and was produced by the US government as a way to pursue
        the USSR to stop the race to the moon.  This is due to the fact that there were no stars in the sky
        from the moon photos and the fact that the flag was waving when the moon had very little atmosphere
        and therefore should have no breeze.<sup><a href="#10" class="reference">10</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p class="Information">
        Apollo 13 was the first space mission that involved humans surviving a spacecraft explosion.
        <sup><a href="#11" class="reference">11</a></sup>Apollo 13 was launched on April 11, 1970
        and was supposed to land on the moon, becoming the 3rd space mission to do so.  However, during the
        mission, there was an issue with the oxygen and the mission had to be aborted.  This is the mission
        that coined the term “Houston We Have A Problem” as this is what the astronauts said to mission control
        when it was determined there were issues.  The space mission decided not to land on the moon, and
        instead returned safely to Earth and became the first space mission that had astronauts return
        safely after a malfunction.
